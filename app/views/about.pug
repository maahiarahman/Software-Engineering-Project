      h2 How It Started
      p
        | The idea came to us during a brainstorming session. We wanted to build something meaningful, something everyone could relate to — food.
        br
        | But not just recipes. We wanted to encourage people to think sustainably, reuse ingredients, and celebrate diverse cuisines.
        br
        | That’s how NomNom was born — a space where users can swap recipes, track sustainable actions, and engage with a growing food-loving community.
